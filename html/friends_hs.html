      					I met Ella back in second year high school, and since then we have been through so much hardship that made our friendship continue to grow stronger. We actually don't fight with each other, but back then we had this huge fight that went on for so long that we have forgotten what it was all about. She was actually the one who was brave enough to say sorry to me and that really made me happy, because honestly I am a very stubborn person and if she didn't apologize we probably wouldn't be best friends until today. <br><br>

						Ella is one of the best people that I know, and I am not saying this just because she is my best friend, but because of her admirable qualities. She is the type of friend that will take very good care of you and is very supportive as if she is your mother. There were actually countless of times when she reprimanded me because of my messy hair or wrinkled uniform, and she would often fix my outfit during school events or class presentations. Even now, even though we're already in college and I'm hundreds of miles away, she still remembers to tell me to iron my uniform because she knows how lazy I am. She is also honest and loyal, and would stand by you even though the whole world is against you. Of course, she would tell you if you're actually at fault, but she wouldn't leave you just because of that. Whenever I am down or mad, she is always there to listen to all my problems. She doesn't complain even though I am being too talkative or I complain too much, rather she comforts me. She is very trustworthy so I probably have said almost all of my secrets to her, and in return she also shares her secrets with me. 

						<br><br>

						Our relationship is so tight that we already know how the other person would react in a situation. We know each other very much but of course at some point we learn something new about each other. With just one look, we already know what the other one wants to say. It is really nice to have a friend who knows you very well and could relate to you. I believe our friendship is really stronger as compared to before and we wouldn't just believe what other people would say. I value our friendship so much that I would risk almost everything for it, because it is very hard to fight another person like her.

      					I entered St Paul University Quezon City back in 2010 and Ella was one of my first friends there. The truth is when i first saw ella i was kind of intimidated because of her looks, but as they say looks can be deceiving. She was very very nice, she has an amazing singing voice and she was very considerate. Before i knew it, she was one of my closest friends there and i really appreciated that. The truth is because of her i got to know my first girlfriend and i really owe her for that. 
      					<br><br>

						After my first year of staying at St Paul we kind of drifted apart because we were in different classes and her best friend was my ex girlfriend and it felt awkward to talk to her because of that. We still chatted a bit from time to time but it wasn't the same as before.
						<br><br>

						Then my last year of high school came. I had a lot of opportunities to talk to her and because of that we continued to be good friends and because of her i was able to talk to my ex girlfriend again (we 3 are best friends now). I had a lot of good memories with her in my last year of high school like hanging out from time to time, going to a pool with her and other friends, etc. 
						<br><br>

						But obviously high school has to end and people go on their separate ways. Luckily, we didn't drift apart that much. We still talk a lot about our interests (movies, tv series, etc.), She still rants about the bad things that happen to her, we still meet up from time to time and most of all she is still my friend. <br><br>

						For me being a friend means a lot. I can only name 5 people who i consider my friends for life  and ella is obviously one of them because even though high school ended 3 years ago she still considers me as one of her close friends and i really appreciate that.

      					There's one thing I remember about Ella. The "I want to be as big as Jollibee" song. HAHAHAHA, even though in Highschool we barely talk because we have a different crew (even tho we are all friends at the same time), she's also open to everyone. Very friendly and reponsible. Oh, and she once hated Anime but now, she's a lover heart emoticon Even though a year has passed, she still maintained to be everyone's all around friend. And that's what makes her Ella.

      					Ever since I met Ella,she has always been kind,thoughtful and very generous.She's the type of friend who gives lots very good advice and she's someone who you can depend on.She's easy to talk to and very fun to be with.When I'm with her,there isn't a time when I wouldn't be laughing my heart out.I also think that she's very capable of being a great leader,with outstanding leadership skills as what I've experienced during our High school days.I'm really thankful that I've had the privilege of having a friend like Ella.A true,reliable,fun,all around friend who will never fail to amaze me.

      					I've never really knew how to describe ella in just a word. Whenever someone asks me what she's like, a dozen memories flood into my mind and then I'd just smile and say "she's ella". A wonderful friend, great company, good listener and an amazing singer. Those words aren't enough to describe who ella is. Try hanging out with her and you'll know.
