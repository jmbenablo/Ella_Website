      					Three years ago, a gateway between Earth and the Beyond opened over the city of New York. In one terrible night, New York was destroyed and rebuilt, trapping New Yorkers and extradimentional creatures alike in an impenetrable bubble. Now, New York has been rechristened New Jerusalem, a paranormal melting pot where magic and madness dwell alongside the mundane, where every form of human vermin gathers to exploit otherwordly assets for earthly profit. Now someone is threatening to breach the bubble and release New Jerusalemâ€™s horrors, but the mysterious superagents of Libra fight to prevent the unthinkable.

But just as Soma graduates from middle school, his father, Joichiro Yukihira, closes down the restaurant to cook in America. However, Soma's fighting spirit is rekindled by a challenge from Joichiro which is to survive in an elite culinary school where only 10% of the students manage to graduate.

      				<br>
      				<p>
      					The story follows Ken Kaneki, a college student who barely survives a deadly encounter with Rize Kamishiro, his date who reveals herself as a ghoul, a human-like creature that hunts and devours human flesh, and is taken to the hospital in critical condition. After recovering, Kaneki discovers that somehow he underwent a surgery that transformed him into a half-ghoul by transferring some of Rize's organs into his body, as she died when she attacked him, and just like them, he must consume human flesh to survive as well. With no one else to turn to, he is taken in by the ghouls who manage the coffee shop "Anteiku", who teach him to deal with his new life as a half-human/half-ghoul, including interacting with ghoul society and its conflicting factions, while striving to keep his identity secret from other humans.

      					In 1972, an ancient alien hypergate was discovered on the surface of the moon. Using this technology, humanity began migrating to Mars and settling there. After settlers discovered additional advanced technology, the Vers Empire was founded, which claimed Mars and its secrets for themselves. Later, the Vers Empire declared war on Earth, and in 1999, a battle on the Moon's surface caused the hypergate to explode, shattering the Moon and scattering remnants into a debris belt around the planet. Cut off from Mars, the remnants of the Vers Imperial Army established several massive orbital space stations within the debris belt and a ceasefire was established. 15 years later, in 2014, an attack on the Vers princess during a peace mission causes the Empire to launch a new attack on Earth, this time determined to conquer it once and for all.

	   					Whenever two people on Earth die at the same time, they are sent to one of many mysterious bars run by bartenders serving as arbiters. There, they must participate in Death Games with their lives on the line, the results of which reveal what secrets led them to their situation and what their fate will be afterwards, with the arbiters judging if their souls will either be sent for reincarnation or banished into the void. The series follows Decim, the lone bartender of the Quindecim bar, whose role in judging these souls changes when he meets a curious black-haired woman.
